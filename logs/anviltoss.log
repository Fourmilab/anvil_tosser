                       Development Log

2019 December 25

This is an overall log for the Anvil Toss project, created at
the time the Git repository was created.  The structure of the
project, and hence this repository, is more complex than a
typical item created for the Second Life marketplace because
many of the components developed herein will be re-used in other
projects under development.  The target and its markers, the
impact markers for off-target collisions, and the projectile
logic are completely general-purpose and may be used with other
models.

The repository consists of a subdirectories for each component
of the project, as follows:

    anvil
        Includes the generic anvil mesh model, the wearable
        anvil tosser, and the actual anvil projectile which
        it throws.  Subdirectories are:
            logs        Development logs
            meshes      DAE files for the anvil (regular
                        low resolution)
            meshes/blender  Blender models for the above
            scripts     LSL scripts for the anvil tosser
                        and projectile

    impact_marker
        The star marker which is placed upon impacts of the
        anvil projectile anywhere except on the target.
        Subdirectories are:
            logs        Development log
            scripts     LSL script
            textures    Texture for the five pointed star
                        with transparent background

    target
        The target and stand.  The stand is non-scripted and
        need not be used with the target (if, for example, you're
        placing it flat on the ground as a bombing target or
        on the wall of a building).  The target markers, which
        are placed at the point of impact, are included.
            logs        Development log
            scripts     LSL scripts for the target and markers
            textures    Texture for the target bullseye and rings
            textures/gimp  GIMP master files for the above

    marketplace
        Files for the marketplace listing of the composite
        product.

Because the anvil tosser, anvil projectile, impact markers,
target, and target markers all interact with one another and
communicate by passing messages among their scripts, it isn't
always obvious which development log describes a given
function.  It's best to read all of the logs before digging into
the individual scripts to add features or modify their
behaviour.
