[Fourmilab Anvil Tosser](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Fourmilab-Anvil-Tosser-and-Target/18734819)
is a game for the Second Life virtual world which illustrates physical 
projectiles, collisions, trajectory calculation, and communication 
among independent objects.  Players compete throwing anvils (which are 
physical objects affected by gravity and {very slightly} wind) at a 
target.  Impacts on the target are marked and scored by their closeness 
to the bullseye, scores are reported to players, and a "leader board"
of top scores is maintained.  Anvils may be thrown at other objects,
with the location of impact marked by temporary markers which go
away after a period of time.

This repository contains all of the software and resources,
including programs in Linden Scripting Language, textures,
notecards, and development documentation, tools, and resources
used the model and its development.  The actual model is built
within Second Life and these components are installed within it.
