Set the texture to Full Bright so it is clearly visible
regardless of the angle of illumination.

Deleted a lot of unnecessary complexity in the script.  Since
this is an object rezzed by a projectile on impact, there is no
need for the machinery for user commands via local chat, as they
would only affect the ephemeral instance which will soon delete
itself.  If we wish any external configuration, it will have to
be passed in via the start parameter, which is presently only
used to convey the time to live.

Upon further (*ahem*) reflection, I decided to make the impact
marker, which had previously only had the star on one side and
was transparent on the other, double-sided.  This avoids the
confusion when you're moving around and the markers disappear
when seen from the back.  Note that the texture must be rotated
180 degrees on the reverse to line up with the obverse.

Added logic to obtain the colour of the marker and its time to
live from the start_param in on_rez().  This allows the
projectile to pass along this information from the launcher.
